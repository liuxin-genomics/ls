# Welcome to Liu Xin's Lab

Welcome to the official website of Liu Xin's Lab! We are dedicated to advancing research in the fields of genomics, population evolutionary genomics, and bioinformatics.

## Research Directions

Our research primarily focuses on the following areas:

### Genomics

We conduct extensive studies on the assembly and evolution of large genomes in both plants and animals. Our work aims to uncover the genetic underpinnings of biodiversity and adaptation.

### Population Evolutionary Genomics

We utilize whole-genome resequencing to investigate population genomics. This research helps us understand genetic variation and its implications for species resilience and agricultural improvement.

### Bioinformatics

Our lab employs cutting-edge bioinformatics methods to facilitate genomic sequencing applications in breeding practices. We aim to develop innovative solutions that integrate genomic data into practical breeding strategies.

## Research Achievements

Since 2014, our lab has contributed significantly to scientific research, resulting in the publication of over 164 SCI papers, with 59 appearing in prestigious journals such as *Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell*.
